# OmniOne Open DID
The OmniOne Open DID Project aims to enhance the authenticity and reliability of digital identity verification by developing a standardized and interoperable framework. It seeks to build and manage a global ecosystem, form a collaborative network, and drive the growth of the DID industry through the dissemination of standard technologies. 

On this journey, OmniOne respects the power of the Open DID community and aims to integrate a global digital identity verification platform based on blockchain, ensuring easy and accessible benefits from public institutions, welfare, healthcare, education, and economic infrastructure for everyone. 

Furthermore, we will establish a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) system for marginalized communities worldwide and provide various benefits to diverse participants in the ecosystem. By doing so, we aim to reduce social costs and fulfill our social responsibility in creating a virtuous cycle within the identity ecosystem.
